Officials will use the same words and phrases in alerts to explain what is happening. Learn the meaning of these common alerts. Knowing what these words mean can help you act more quickly.

Those who require additional time to evacuate, and those with pets and livestock, should leave now. Shelter in Place: Go indoors. Shut and lock doors and windows. Prepare to stay inside until further notice and or contacted by emergency personnel for additional direction.

Soft Closure: Closed to all traffic except fire, law enforcement and critical resources. Resident Only Closure: Soft closure while allowing residents and local government agencies assisting with response and recovery to enter.

Stay safe by being earthquake ready. Practice DROP, COVER, and HOLD ON at home and work. Get life-saving seconds to stay safe before shaking starts by downloading and setting up alerts from California’s Earthquake Early Warning system at earthquake.ca.gov. Secure loose and tall furniture to minimize damage or threat of injury. Have a Go Bag and shoes in a place that you can find quickly if you have to evacuate. PROTECT YOURSELF DURING EARTHQUAKES If inside, do not rush outside or stand in a doorway. Never use elevators! Remember, DROP, COVER, and HOLD ON. If in bed, stay there and COVER your head with a pillow. If outdoors, move away from anything that can fall, especially power lines, trees, street lights, and buildings. If driving, pull over and set the parking brake. Make sure you stop away from trees, bridges, buildings, or power lines. STAY ALERT AFTER EARTHQUAKES Be ready for aftershocks over several days or weeks. Whenever you feel shaking, DROP, COVER, and HOLD ON. Listen to local radio and TV programs for reliable emergency information and watch out for official emergency alerts. If near the coast, evacuate as soon as the shaking stops. Earthquakes can lead to tsunamis, and you should not return until there is an all clear announcement. Check for hazards around you, including gas leaks, downed power lines, ruptured pipes, and more. If you smell gas, evacuate everyone immediately. Do not enter damaged buildings! Wait until officials say it is safe, even if that means waiting at a shelter. Call your local or county authorities to find exit routes to the nearest shelter.

This includes requesting a leave of absence or transfer. If you apply for benefits, we will interview both you and your employer to determine your eligibility.

Start by gathering this information: Personal Information: Your name, birth date, address, Social Security number, photo identification (such as driver's license, ID card, or passport), and another identity document (such as W2, utility bill, or birth certificate). To avoid delays, your information should match what’s on file with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or Social Security Administration. View the full list of acceptable documents for identity verification. Past 18 Months of Employment Information: Employer names, mailing and physical addresses, dates worked, gross wages (total before taxes and deductions), hours worked, and how you were paid (such as weekly or monthly). Most Recent Employer Information: Contact information (name, address, and phone number) for your most recent employer and your immediate supervisor, the date when you last worked for this last employer, and gross wages in the “last week” you worked. Last week means Sunday until Saturday. Reason You Aren’t Working (or had your hours cut): If you voluntarily quit or were fired (sometimes called terminated, discharged, or let go) for misconduct, you may not be eligible for benefits. Citizenship: If you are registered with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as a non-citizen, you’ll need your USCIS document, such as your Permanent Resident Card, Employment Authorization Card, or Refugee Travel Document. Federal Employment: If you worked for the federal government during the last 18 months, you’ll need your Notice to Federal Employee About Unemployment Insurance, Standard Form 8. Military Service: If you served in the military in the last 18 months, you’ll need your DD214 Member Copy 4. If you have questions about gathering this information, take a look at our How to Apply for Unemployment (DE 2321) guide or these Frequently Asked Questions. If you were incorrectly classified by your employer as an independent contractor, you may still qualify for benefits. Now you’re ready to apply!
